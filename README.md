Vehicle Speed and Number Plate Detection System

This project, titled Vehicle Speed and Number Plate Detection, falls into the category of computer vision. It uses image segmentation and contour detection to identify vehicle license plates and track vehicle speeds. The primary objective is to monitor and ensure that speed limits are followed, thus improving road safety by penalizing speeding vehicles in real-time.

Motivation

Road accidents are one of the major issues in Nepal, claiming numerous lives every year. One of the core objectives of this system is to reduce traffic accidents by monitoring vehicles in high-risk zones and penalizing those exceeding speed limits. This system increases driver awareness and discourages speeding, which can help lower fatality rates on the road.

Project Objectives

Speed Monitoring: The system monitors and tracks vehicle speeds, ensuring that speed restrictions are enforced. This can help reduce accidents and prevent injuries or fatalities.
Number Plate Detection: Using deep learning models, the system accurately reads vehicle number plates, which can be used for multiple purposes such as:
Traffic flow analysis
Parking management
Toll collection
Law enforcement
Features

Real-time Monitoring: The system operates in real-time, detecting speeding vehicles and other potential risks such as vehicles involved in suspicious activities. This enables quick responses from law enforcement.
Accurate Data for Traffic Management: The system provides accurate vehicle and location data, which is valuable for traffic management, safety measures, and emergency responses.
Emergency Support: In case of an accident, the system provides precise location data, aiding emergency services in responding faster.
Technologies Used

This project leverages state-of-the-art technologies for computer vision and machine learning:

OpenCV: For image processing and computer vision tasks.
YOLOv8: For real-time object detection, specifically used to detect vehicles and license plates.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): For deep learning-based object detection and classification.
Machine Learning Techniques: Used to enhance the accuracy of vehicle speed estimation and license plate detection.
Benefits

Increased Road Safety: By identifying speeding vehicles and enforcing penalties, the system helps to ensure that drivers are more cautious, potentially reducing accidents.
Law Enforcement: With the ability to automatically detect and identify vehicles, law enforcement can monitor high-risk areas and take immediate action.
Traffic Management: Provides authorities with useful data for analyzing traffic patterns and improving road infrastructure.
Conclusion

This system is designed to improve road safety by leveraging deep learning and computer vision techniques to monitor traffic, identify speeding vehicles, and capture license plate numbers. It can be applied to multiple use cases, including traffic management, law enforcement, and accident prevention.
